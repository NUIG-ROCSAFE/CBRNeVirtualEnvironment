Clinical signs are nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs, and the skin can be also affected. Human infections have occurred sporadically in laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected domestic animals. Symptoms depend on the route of infection: localised skin infections with ulceration and swollen lymph nodes. Pulmonary infections with pneumonia, pulmonary abscesses, pleural effusion and septicaemia are usually fatal. Chronic infections with necrotizing granulomas in different organs are reported. Because of the small number of bacteria necessary for infection and the high mortality rate in untreated cases, B. mallei is considered as a potential biological weapon.

The bacterium can be isolated from the soil and muddy water, which also represent the source of infections for humans and animals. Infections can occur by ingestion, inhalation or through wounds and abrasions. The course of the infection is influenced by the bacterial strain, the immune status of the individual and the route and dose of infection. Depending on the dose of infection, the incubation time is days to years. Chronic melioidosis is characterised by abscesses, which can occur in a variety of organs. Pulmonary disease is the most common form with fever, coughing and pleuritic chest pain; untreated cases may progress to septicaemia that is the most severe form of the disease with a mortality rate of <90% in untreated and 30% in treated patients. B. pseudomallei is of concern as a potential agent for biological weapons and bioterrorism. Burkholderia pseudomallei is genetically closely related to Burkholderia mallei.

The CLP Regulation (European Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures) adopts the United Nations Globally Harmonized System on the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) across all European Union countries. As the GHS is a voluntary agreement rather than a law, it must be adopted through a suitable national or regional legal mechanism to ensure it becomes legally binding. 
It is expected to facilitate global trade and the harmonised communication of chemical hazard information and to promote regulatory efficiency. It complements the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation (EC No 190) and replaces the current system within the Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC) and the Dangerous Preparations Directive (1999/45/EC).
The CLP Regulation incorporates the classification criteria and labelling rules agreed at UN level, the so-called Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). It introduces new classification criteria, hazard symbols (pictograms), hazard statements and precautionary statements, while taking account of elements, which are part of the current EU legislation.

Chemical Warfare Agents
Chemical warfare agents (CWA) are a group of toxic substances developed for military use. The so-called toxic agents (also called casualty a. or lethal a.) are intended to cause death or serious injury through their toxicological effects in exposed humans or animals, and include:
pulmonary agents (lung-damaging agents, also called choking agents);
blood agents (cyanides);
blistering agents (vesicants); and
nerve agents.
In addition to the above, there is a group of incapacitating agents or non-lethal agents which are intended to cause incapacitation (a temporary inability to perform ones duties).
The most important examples are BZ (causing hallucinations) and fentanyl derivatives(causing unconsciousness).
Riot-control agents, like tear gases, pepper spray or vomiting agents, are not recognised as incapacitating agents or CWA if they are used by law enforcement.
Most chemical warfare agents are liquids (except for riot-control agents and BZ, which are solids at temperatures and pressures normally encountered).

State party obligations (art. I: never to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, or retain chemical weapons and to destroy all chemical weapons stockpiles as well as all production facilities);
the destruction of chemical weapons (art. IV); and
the shutdown of production facilities (art. V).
For preventing the spread of precursors and toxic chemicals that may be used as weapons, their development, production, acquisition, retaining, transfer and use are subject to limits (art.VI) and inspections. Implementation of the Convention is monitored by the OPCW  Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

Density
Density (symbol:   (Greek: rho)) is the ratio of mass per volume  thus, the correct term in full is volumetric mass density. The average density of an object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. An object made from a comparatively dense material (such as iron) will have less volume than an object of equal mass made from a less-dense substance (such as water). The SI unit of density is the kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3).

The ERPG value is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour,without:
(1) experiencing anything other than mild transient adverse health effects or perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odour (ERPG-1);
(2) experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action (ERPG-2); or

Francisella tularensis
Bacteria, cause of the disease tularaemia, which can affect humans and animals (especially rodents, rabbits and hares). Transmission routes are cutaneous/ocular (skin and/or eye contact with bacteria), pulmonary (inhalation of bacteria) or oral (ingestion of bacteria). Symptoms depend on transmission routes and affect mainly the site of entry. Systemic infections (e. g. after ingestion or inhalation) show a higher fatality rate. Transmission by insect bites is relevant. No known transmission between humans. Two types of Francisella tularensis are relevant for human infections: Francisella tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) (Northern America) and Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) (worldwide). Infections with type A are the more severe disease. Ciprofloxacine, streptomycin and doxycycline are first-line antibiotic treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis. A vaccine against tularaemia does exist and is authorised in a few countries (e. g. Russia) but availability is limited.

GHS
The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) classifies chemicals by types of hazard and proposes harmonised hazard communication elements, including labels and safety data sheets. It aims to ensure the availability of information on physical hazards and toxicity from chemicals so as to enhance the protection of human health and the environment during the handling, transport and use of such chemicals. 
The GHS also provides a basis for the harmonisation of rules and regulations on chemicals at national, regional and worldwide level, which is important to facilitate trade, too. It aims to apply consistent classification criteria, hazard classes and categories, and elements of hazard communication (labels) at a global level.

Gamma rays are a type of ionizing radiation, which may be emitted in the process of spontaneous disintegration of unstable atomic nuclei, usually accompanying other decays. 
Gamma photons have about 10,000 times as much energy as the photons in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because of their high energy they can cover hundreds to thousands of meters in air before being absorbed. They can pass through many kinds of materials, including human tissue. Very dense materials, such as lead, are commonly used as shielding to slow or stop gamma photons.

Latency
is the time delay between exposure and the first sign of symptoms. It is one of the defining factors for any toxic effect: toxicity, latency, persistency and transmissibility of the toxic substance.
In substances with short latency, the effects will be immediately recognisable; examples are fast-acting pulmonary agents (with high water solubility), tear gas, nerve agents or cyanides.
In substances with long latency, exposure may take place unknowingly, e.g. in the case of sulphur mustard exposure. After exposure to slow-acting pulmonary agents (with low water solubility) delayed lung oedema may occur.

PPM conversion
The term ppm is often used for the concentration of air or liquid mixtures. It means parts per million by volume or by mole; ppms are identical for an ideal gas and almost identical for most gases at 1 atm. One part per million (by volume) is equal to the volume of a given gas mixed in a million volumes of air, therefore a microlitre volume of gas in one litre of air is equal to 1 ppm:
1 ppm = 0.0001 %; 100 ppm = 0.01 %.
The other frequently used expression for concentration is mg/m3. Conversion between these two values is possible by using the following equation:

Persistency
the continued or prolonged existence of a substance. With reference to chemicals, it is the ability over time to remain in an active state within the environment (and, in case of CWA, to still pose a threat). Persistency is a defining factor for any toxic effect: toxicity, latency, persistency and transmissibility of the toxic substance. It is inversely related to volatility: the more volatile a substance is, the quicker it evaporates and the less it tends to persist as a liquid and to contaminate terrain and material.

Primary explosives
are substances or mixtures that can easily be detonated by a non-explosive simple initiating impulse such as a flame, impact, friction, heat, electric spark etc. They are mainly used in applications where it is desired to produce a shock wave for initiation of a less sensitive secondary explosive or a flame for initiation of propellants. Most of the primary explosives are highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli that make handling them very dangerous.

In addition, it regulates the storage of Information about the properties of substances in a database (REACH-IT), which is operated by the European Chemical Agency (ECHA).
Under REACH, companies are responsible for identifying and managing the risks associated with the substances they manufacture and market in the EU. They have to demonstrate to ECHA how the substance can be used safely and register this information with ECHA where it is made freely available on the Agencys website. Companies must also communicate risk-management measures to users; the main instrument for this information is the safety data sheet.

Radiation is a form of energy emitted during radioactive decay. There are two basic types of radiation: ionising and non-ionising, depending on their energy. Ionising radiation  IR, with energy above 5 eV (electron volt), such as alpha particles and X-rays  can ionise atoms, which means it can remove electrons from atomic shells. Non-ionising radiation  NIR, with energy below 3 eV, like, for example, ultraviolet (UV) light and visible light  cannot ionise atoms.

The sulphur mustards, also known as mustard gas and sometimes only called mustard, are a group of related cytotoxic chemical warfare agents able to produce large blisters on exposed skin. Sulphur mustard is the main representative of blister agents.
Synonyms: H (impure sulphur mustard), HD (distilled sulphur mustard), S-Lost, Yperite. At room temperature, pure sulphur mustards are colourless or yellowish viscous liquids (with low volatility and high persistency). It is alleged that mustard received its name either from its smell or taste (onion, garlic, mustard) or its yellow-brown colour. Symptoms begin hours after exposure with severe pain at the exposed area. Exposure is frequently not immediately recognised by the affected person. The skin goes red and blisters and develops slow-healing chemical burns; the eyes become irritated and severe damage can lead to temporary functional blindness; and respiratory symptoms can range from irritation to lung oedema and airway damage. Severe illness and death will occur after high doses. In addition, sulphur mustard is strongly mutagenic and carcinogenic.

The chemical element uranium (U) is a very dense, heavy and silvery-white metal found naturally as ore in deposits. It is composed of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (more than 99 %), uranium-235 (0.72 %), and uranium-234 (0.005 %). Exposure to uranium can result in both chemical and radiological toxic effects. Chemically, it is very toxic after ingestion or inhalation, the main target organ being the kidney. It is used to fuel nuclear reactors, often after the per cent composition of uranium-235 has been increased to form enriched uranium (typically 3-5 % enrichment) or to produce nuclear weapons (90 % or more enrichment).

Vector, biological
Infectious agents can be transmitted by living and dead vectors. Furthermore vectors can act mechanically or biologically. Mechanical transmission can occur by picking up an infectious agent (from clothes or surfaces) and by transmitting it to a susceptible host by direct contact with the contaminated material. Often biological vectors replicate the infectious agents in their bodies and transmit the agent to the host in an active manner. Of special interest are arthropod vectors (e.g. mosquitos, ticks etc.) that can take up the infectious agent generally by biting and replicate the pathogen (viruses [i.e. arboviruses], bacteria [plague] or parasites [malaria]) without signs of an infection. Transmission of the agent from the vector to the (uninfected) host occurs by biting, in general during a blood meal.
